Being held accountable gives our families the reassurance that we are who we say we are.  It also holds ourselves accountable to continue to offer a program that provides our students with rich learning engagements.  </li>
                <li className="par">I have led our school through a PYP authorization visit in 2010, evaluation visit in 2015 and a Ministry inspection every other year since 2013.  An important piece of the evaluation process is openly sharing with staff the results of the reports  Reflecting on feedback often drives changes in curriculum delivery and improved student achievement.  Feedback from external bodies can also drive future professional development plans.</li>
