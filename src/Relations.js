                <p className='par'>Building relationships with staff is key and begins immediately.  I developed the MacLachlan New Teacher Orientation Program and continue to be a part of the team to deliver the workshops over two days in August.</p>
                <li className="dot">Encouraging Professional Development</li>
                <p className='par'>I present a budget to the Board for staff PD and encourage all staff to participate in continued PD to encourage new practices that match their interests and the school's goals.  Some of these have included PYP Workshops, Levels 1, 2 & 3, Cohort 21, Harvard's Project Zero and CIS Workshops.</p>
                <li className="dot">Meetings & Conferences</li>
                <p className='par'>I meet with teachers in several different ways, staff, divisional, grade and committee meetings are scheduled throughout the school year and each of those schedules are set in August prior to the start of that school year.  Individual meetings are made as needed and my door is always open.</p>

I also end the day with traffic duty to say good-bye to students as they leave for the day.  I am highly visible in school events including Galas, Fun Fairs, Spirit Days and Student Staff sports.</p>
