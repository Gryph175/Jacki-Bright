        title: 'Set Direction',
        contents: 'My proudest accomplishment to date has been successfully leading MacLachlan College through the process of becoming the first IB World School in Oakville to offer the Primary Years Programme (PYP). With the support of the Board and the Administration Team, I set a new direction for MacLachlan as I lead the staff through the candidacy phase and the authorization process. I continued to lead the school through two action plans, the first as a result of our authorization and the second after our first evaluation visit.',

        title: 'Set Goals',
        contents: 'I strongly believe in the IB Mission Statement. I believe in educating the whole child, not only academically but socially and emotionally as well. It was important for the staff to share that same vision and understand the pedagogy behind the IB Mission Statement. I identified specific and short-term goals to start. This included having all staff complete the Making the PYP Happen, Level 1 Workshop. Through my strong encouragement the Board gave approval to extend our candidacy phase over a two-year period. This allowed time for staff to become familiar with the program, begin to implement parts into their teaching and share good practices with colleagues.',

The school’s Programme of Inquiry continues to be revised through regular reflection. Our newly developed curriculum also required newly designed classroom spaces. I worked with Steelcase, administration and staff to redesign our classroom spaces to allow for active learning and collaborative spaces.',

        title: 'Communicate the vision and goals',

I updated the Board annually at Board meetings.  Updated and educated parents through information evenings, special events and assemblies.
